# Rive for Unity: Quick Start

This guide covers the essentials for getting started with Rive in Unity immediately.

---

## 1) Display the Included Rive File
> Note:the `com.unity.ugui` package is required (typically included by default in new Unity projects).

Locate the included sample in:  
`/Demo/RiveFiles/quick_start_health_bar.riv`

Then choose how you want to display it:

**In UI (Canvas):** Drag the file into the **Scene Hierarchy** to create a screen-space setup inside a uGUI Canvas.


**On a Mesh:** Drag the file onto a GameObject with a `MeshRenderer`. Unity sets up a **Rive Panel** and **Rive Texture Renderer** automatically.

**Via the context menu:** Right-click in the Scene Hierarchy and use:
- `Rive > Rive Panel`
- `Rive > Rive Panel (Canvas)`
- `Rive > Widgets > Rive Widget`

## 2) Add More Rive Files

Once you've tested with the included file, import additional `.riv` files by dragging them into the Unity **Project** window. To find more files to download or remix:
